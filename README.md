# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project was heavily inspired by [Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer). Altough the end result of the two project are similar, it is quite obvious no code was copied if you take a look at the source code of my version. I googled how to do some parts I didn't know piece by piece and built the rest on my own instead of looking at how Clement approached his implementation. I believe that this is the most productive approach for me to improve my software development skills.

# Pathfinding Visualizer (Not Maintained)

The repository of the working version of the Pathfinding Visualizer can be viewed [here](https://github.com/imaique/pathfinding-visualizer-2).

This project is a failed attempt at creating a Pathfinding Visualizer using React. It made me learn a lot more about React and also made me realize that it was a bit overkill for this relatively simple project.
